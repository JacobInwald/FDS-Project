        What questions are you setting out to answer?
        We set out to investigate the relationship between various factors and the
            rating or gross revenue of a movie.
        There are are various factors that can come into play affecting the rating a
            movie gets or the success of that movie at box office.

        We will investigate the effect these factors have on movie reception, and
            attempt to determine which are most impactful to the success of a movie.
