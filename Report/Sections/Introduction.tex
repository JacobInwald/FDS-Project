    \paragraph{Context and motivation}
        The global movie industry is immense, with a total of 629,807 titles listed on
            IMDb as of December 2022~\cite{imdbStats}, some dating as far back as
            1894~\cite{imdbOldest}.
        With such a vast selection, it is impossible for all movies to become
            successful blockbusters.
        This raises the question: what factors contribute to a movie's success?
        There is an abundance of data available regarding movies, their cast, crew, and
            even their audiences.
        This data can be used to gain insight into the production, reception, and
            overall success of films.
        This study aims to explore how different metrics can predict the success of a
            movie before it gets released to the general public.
        Success in this context is defined as the amount of revenue generated by the
            movie.

        When it comes to movie ratings, there are often two different scores available:
            one from the general public and the other from professional movie critics.
        At times, scores may be nearly identical.
        For instance, "The Godfather"~\cite{rottenTomatoesGodfather} received nearly
            identical scores from both groups.
        On the other hand, "The Last Jedi"~\cite{rottenTomatoesLastJedi} saw a
            significant difference between the two.
        The disparity between ratings for certain movies can make it challenging to
            determine whether they were successful.

    \paragraph{Previous work}
        Recent research has explored the various factors that contribute to the success
            or failure of films.
        Several studies and papers have been conducted in this field, examining a range
            of elements.
        Previous research has investigated the potential of utilizing IMDb data to
            predict the success of films~\cite{dhirRaj}.
        Other studies have sought to identify the factors that contribute to the making
            of a blockbuster movie~\cite{collinsHandSnell}.
        Moreover, further studies have attempted to develop their own mathematical
            models to predict the success of upcoming
            movies~\cite{ahmadDuraisamyYousefBuckles}.

    \paragraph{Objectives}
        This study seeks to identify the most influential factors in determining a
            movie's success.
        With the multitude of factors that could potentially affect a movie's
            performance at the box office, it is not feasible to investigate them all.
        Therefore, we will focus our research on the director, actors, genre and
            runtime of a movie, and compare these with its viewer rating, critic score and
            box office revenue.
        We will be exploring the following question in depth: who is more accurate in
            predicting a movie's success, critics or the general public?
        Additionally, we will investigate the influence of a movie's director and
            actors on its success, as well as the genres that are most likely to produce
            successful films.
