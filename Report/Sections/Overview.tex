        This report analyses the impact of critics on the success of movies within the
            film industry.
        We carried out this analysis using data from IMDb which provided statistics on
            one thousand movies released between 2006 and 2016.
        A least squares multiple regression model was used to determine which factors
            of a movie can be used to predict their box office success, while another least
            squares multiple regression model was used to determine if critics were able to
            predict success based on a metric which combines the revenue and viewer rating
            of that movie.
        We found that a movie's revenue is correlated by the number of votes it has on
            IMDb, its runtime and the experience of actors in its leading roles.
        We further found that critics ratings cannot be used to predict the box office
            success of a movie, but can predict how the public will recieve it, and that
            actor experience is a better prediction of box office success than director
            experience.
