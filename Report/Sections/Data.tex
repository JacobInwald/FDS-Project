    \paragraph{Data provenance}
        We used two datasets to aid our investigation: an IMDB movie dataset, containing
            various details about movies made from 2006-2016; and a larger movie dataset (TMD),
            containing details about movies released on or before July 2017.
        The IMDB dataset has a bit of a contentious past as it was scraped off of the movie
            ranking website IMDB.com, and is actually only a sample dataset from a much larger
            dataset that has every movie made from 2006-2016 that is in the IMDB.
        The large movie dataset (TMD) was collated using data from TMDB (The Movie DataBase) and 
            grouplens.org; but we only use the part that was obtained from TMDB as it is used
            to find Director and Actor experience.

        Both datasets were downloaded from kaggle.com, a data science platform that enables users
            to access and share datasets. These datsets are shared underneath the CC0 1.0 Universal
            Public Domain Dedication, as such we will use them underneath fair use.

    \paragraph{Data description}
        The IMDB movie dataset has 12 columns, all either containing string values or floating point values.
        The only odd column is the Genre column which contains the different genres that can be applied to a particular movie.
        The genres that are in this dataset are the arbritary genres:

        The TMD dataset used had a bit of a more odd structure.
        We only used the crew.csv file that is a small part of the larger dataset, so we only explain the structure of crew.csv.
        This file was composed of three columns: cast, crew and id.
        The odd part of the dataset is that the cast and crew columns are composed of .json files, and as such we needed to parse 
            out the useful data from these json files to actually get useable data.
        The column summary is shown in Figure \ref*{fig-Credits-Column-Description}.

    \paragraph{Data processing}
        To cleanup the TMD dataset, we made and used a python script that went through all the entries of
            the dataset and extracted two things; number of movies each actor appeared in, and number of movies each director
            directed.
        These two sets of data were saved to .csv files, named actor\_counts.csv and director\_counts respectively.
        \\
        Using this newly acquired data, we merged it with the original IMDB dataset. 
        In the merging process the Description column was dropped, and the Director and Actor columns were replaced with the 
            Director Exp. and Mean Lead Roles Exp.
        This resulted in a merged\_movie\_data.csv file with structure shown in Figure \ref*{fig-merged-data-column-description}
